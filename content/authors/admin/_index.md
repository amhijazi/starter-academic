Welcome to my page! I am a  third-year Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at NC State University advised by [Osman Ozaltin](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/people/oyozalti/).  My research focuses on optimal resource allocation in healthcare and production systems.  Methods include stochastic programming, combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Specific applications include risk-averse vaccine allocation, product transitions in decentralized environments and parallel machine scheduling.

In summer 2020, I did a research internship at Los Alamos National Lab, where I worked with [Hassan Hijazi](https://about.me/hhijazi) on alignment and registration of 3D point-cloud using mathematical optimization.

Before coming to NCSU,  I did my undergrad at the Islamic University of Gaza majoring in Industrial Engineering.
